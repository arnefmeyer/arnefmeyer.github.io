Our recent [preprint](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.20.957712v1){:target="_blank"}
on head and eye movements in freely moving mice has been accepted for
publication in Current Biology. Joint work with John O'Keefe (SWC, London)
and Jasper Poort (University of Cambridge, UK).

The mouse has become one of the most prominent species in vision research,
in part because enormous progress has been made in the last few years in
developing new tools to monitor and manipulate neural activity in mice
and to model human disease. However, how the freely-moving mouse uses eye
and head movements to actively explore its environment is largely unknown.

To answer this outstanding question, in this study we capitalized on a new
technique (Meyer et al., Neuron (2018)) that allowed us to simultaneously
track both eyes together with head movements in freely-moving mice. We find that
most eye movements in mice are coupled to the head in two distinct ways
associated with two different functions. By performing similar experiments in
humans, we show that one of the couplings resembles a major characteristic of
human eye movements (known as "saccade and fixate").
