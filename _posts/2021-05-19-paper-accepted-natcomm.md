Mouse visual cortex contains a region of enhanced spatial resolution. Nature Communications (accepted)

We found that mouse visual cortex contains a region of enhanced spatial resolution. Eye movements keep this region at strategic locations in front of the animal, centered at the horizon, where natural scenes tend to have features such as target locations and landmarks. This suggests that already at an early cortical level, the mouse visual system is adapted to process information relevant for navigation.
