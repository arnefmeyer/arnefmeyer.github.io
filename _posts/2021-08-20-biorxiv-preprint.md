title: New preprint combining tetrodes in silicon probes in freely moving mice
layout: post
---

Ever wanted to combine tetrodes with silicon probes to simultaneously measure 
neural activity from within neural layers and also across layers in a freely 
moving mouse?  A new preprint (together with the Battagla lab) describing 
a small device to do this is now on bioRxiv:
> Guardamagna M, Eichler R, Pedrosa R, Aarts A, **Meyer AF**\*, Battaglia FP\*. [The Hybrid Drive: a chronic implant device combining tetrode arrays with silicon probes for layer-resolved ensemble electrophysiology in freely moving mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.457090v1){:target="_blank"})
bioRxiv, 2021.

We extensively validated the drive and demonstrated its power in a series of 
experiments linking the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal layer neurons to the 
oscillatory activity across hippocampal layers.
