						<h3>Detailed behavioral monitoring in freely moving animals</h3>
						<p>The availability of genetic tools to dissect neural circuitry and
							to construct models of human disease has driven the emergence of the
							mouse as a key model organism in systems neuroscience.
							An increasingly wide array of technologies is available
							to measure and manipulate neural activity in mice. However, detailed
							monitoring of behavior, especially in freely moving animals, remains
							a major challenge. To address this challenge, I developed a
							head-mounted camera system to measure eye position, pupil
							dilation, whisking, pinna movements, and other behavioral
							signals in freely moving mice, combined with head-movement monitoring
							and multichannel electrophysiology (Meyer, Poort et al., Neuron 2018). </p>

						<p>The mouse has become one of the most prominent species in vision
							research, in part because enormous progress has been made in the
							last few years in developing new tools to monitor and manipulate
							neural activity in mice.

							However, how the freely-moving mouse uses	eye and head movements
							to actively explore its environment is largely unknown.

							To answer this outstanding question, we used a system that we
							recently developed
							<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30822-5" target="_blank">(Meyer et al., Neuron 2018)</a>
							to track head	and eye movements in freely moving mice.

							We found that	the complex head and eye movement patterns in
							mice can be decomposed into two distinct, independent
							components each linking eye and head but in different ways.

							These two types eye-head coupling were maintained during
							visually-guided behaviors.

							Additionally, this work resolved an	apparent discrepancy between
							eye	movements observed in head-restrained and freely moving mice,
							demonstrating that eye movements in both conditions are invariably
							associated with either planned or actual head movement
