						<h3>Sensory input during complex behaviors</h3>

						<p>The goal of this project is to understand social behaviours of
              rodents such as mating and territorial aggression, with a focus
              on the (sensory) inputs relevant for these behaviors -- ranging
              from vision to chemoreception.

							The project has been triggered by	a recent observation that mice
							close their eyes when a conspecific is within close distance
							(Meyer et al, bioRxiv 2020).

							By combining experimental manipulations with computational modeling
							we hope to understand whether this observation reflects overt
							sensory modality switching.
