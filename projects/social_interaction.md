The goal of this project is to understand social behaviours of
rodents such as mating and territorial aggression, with a focus
on the (sensory) inputs relevant for these behaviors -- ranging
from vision to chemoreception.
The project has been triggered by	a recent observation that mice
close their eyes when a conspecific is within close distance
(Meyer et al, bioRxiv 2020).
By combining experimental manipulations with computational modeling
we hope to understand whether this observation reflects overt
sensory modality switching.
