The mouse has become one of the most prominent species in vision
research, in part because enormous progress has been made in the
last few years in developing new tools to monitor and manipulate
neural activity in mice.
However, how the freely-moving mouse uses head and eye movements
(gaze) to actively explore its environment is largely unknown.

To answer this outstanding question, we used a system that we
recently developed ([Meyer et al., Neuron (2018)](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30822-5){:target="_blank"})
to track head and eye movements in freely moving mice.
We found that the complex eye movement patterns in mice can
be decomposed into two distinct, independent components each
linking eye and head but in different ways ([Meyer et al., Current Biology (2020)](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30556-X){:target="_blank"}).
By further tracking head and eye movements in mice during social behaviors or
when mice were performing a visually-guided tracking task, we
found that these two types of eye-head coupling were maintained
across a wide range of behaviors.

Current work aims at understanding the statistics of visual
input during a wide range of behaviors and how this relates
to the neural representation of visual input in mouse visual
cortex ([van Beest et al., Nature Communications (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24311-5){:target="_blank"}) and how this is modified by motor-related signals.
