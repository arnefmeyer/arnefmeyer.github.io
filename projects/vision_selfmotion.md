Humans and many other animals strongly rely on vision for guiding actions and
navigation. Indeed, vision provides crucial signals for most behaviors that
involve movement through the environment, such as crossing a busy road.
However, how visual input is transformed into representations that are useful
for action and navigation while an animal is actively moving from one place to
another or reorienting in space is largely unknown.

The goal of this project is to understand how visual input is combined with
information about an animal's own movements to yield a coherent,
egocentric-based representation of the environment.
The classical view of this process is that visual input is first processed by a
series of specialized visual brain areas, and then integrated with self-motion
information in higher-order association areas.
However, there is increasing evidence that non-visual self-motion signals, such
as motor and vestibular signals, are already innervating the visual system at
very early stages (e.g., Meyer et al., Neuron (2018)).

By combining head and eye tracking in freely moving mice with large-scale neural
recordings (e.g., neuropixels), virtual reality, and computational modeling,
I hope to understand (1) how self-motion signals modify representations of
visual input in the early visual system and (2) if the underlying computations
provide an interpretation of this input in an eye-, head-, or body-centered
reference frame.
