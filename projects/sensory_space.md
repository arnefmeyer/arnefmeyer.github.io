title: Linking sensory systems to neural representations of space

Sensory information, in particular visual information, plays a key role in our ability 
to navigate through the environment, from identifying landmarks and obstacles to 
determining location and heading. While we are starting to gain insights into how 
sensory systems work in navigating animals, we know little about how sensory 
information is integrated into the spatial system at the 
neural level.

I am developing novel technology together with machine learning-based analysis 
methods to study sensory and cognitive processes with single-cell resolution in 
freely moving animals.
By combining head and eye tracking in freely moving mice with large-scale neural
recordings (e.g., neuropixels), virtual reality, and computational modeling,
I hope to understand (1) how key aspects of an animal's environment such as 
landmarks are encoded in early and higher visual cortex and (2) how this 
information is integrated into the brain's navigation network.
