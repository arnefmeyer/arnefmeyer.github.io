I am currently a Staff Scientist at [Stepstone](https://www.thestepstonegroup.com/en/){:target="_blank"} leading the development of language model-based approaches to match candidates with jobs. A particular focus is on developing models that are interpretable, fair, and scale to millions of candidates and jobs. I am also a [chapter coach](https://medium.com/stepstone-tech/yet-another-chapter-story-bcd51f40dbac) helping younger scientist to grow and to shape the rapidly growing Data Science community at Stepstone.

Before, I have investigated mouse brain and behavior, as a [Radboud Excellence Fellow](https://www.ru.nl/excellence/){:target="_blank"}
at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/)
(Nijmegen, the Netherlands) and	as a research fellow at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for
Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org){:target="_blank"}
(London, UK) with John O'Keefe.

Even before, I was a research fellow (and project Co-Investigator) at the
[Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}
at University College London (London, UK) where I used machine learning techniques to model the activity of large numbers of neurons. I did my PhD at the [Institute of Physics at the University of
Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en/physics/){:target="_blank"} (Oldenburg, Germany).
