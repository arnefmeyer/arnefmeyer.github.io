I am currently a research associate at University College London (UCL) working at the interface of computational neuroscience (with [Maneesh Sahani](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Emaneesh){:target="_blank"} at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit), in-vivo neurophysiology, and detailed measurements of behaviour in freely moving animals (both with [Jennifer Linden](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/research/profiles/linden){:target="_blank"} at the Ear Institute, and [John O'Keefe](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc/research/OKeefe){:target="_blank"} and [Jasper Poort](http://selectivevisionforaction.blogspot.com){:target="_blank"} at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre).

My overall goal is to understand how relevant sensory stimuli are transformed into behaviour, and, in turn, how the resulting behaviour changes the way subsequent sensory input is being processed. To this end I combine experiments in freely moving mice with methods from dynamical systems, statistical physics and machine learning to construct models of how sensory input is transformed into neural activity. However, not everything happening in sensory cortex is determinted by sensory input. Rather cortical activity also carries information about processes that are not locked to the stimulus, e.g., perception, decisions, or motor-related activity. By carefully monitoring ethologically relevant behaviours along with neural activity I hope to understand which activity patterns are related to sensory input and how these patterns interact with motor-related signals and cognitive processes.

During my PhD at the Institute of Physics at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, I developed computational models of sensory processing along the auditory pathway based on the spectro-temporal receptive field.
