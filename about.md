I am currently a [Radboud Excellence Fellow](https://www.ru.nl/excellence/){:target="_blank"}
at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/)
(Nijmegen, the Netherlands) and	a research fellow at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for
Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org){:target="_blank"}
(London, UK). Before, I was a research fellow (and project Co-Investigator) at the
[Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}
at University College London (London, UK). I did my PhD at the [Institute of Physics at the University of
Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en/physics/){:target="_blank"} (Oldenburg, Germany).
See [here](/cv/index.html) for a more detailed CV.

The goal of my research is to understand how the brain builds a representation
of the world around us. In particular, I am interested in how this representation
arises from the information coming from the senses and how it is modified when
an animal is interacting with its environment to enable flexible yet robust
behavior.

To reach this goal, **I am using a cross-disciplinary approach that combines
methods from statistics and machine learning with experiments in mice**.
Current models of sensory processing, perception and cognition have been developed
to understand behavior under a limited set of idealized laboratory conditions
(e.g., repeated trials in head-fixed animals).
My work aims at studying the brain under more naturalistic conditions (see [research](/research)).
