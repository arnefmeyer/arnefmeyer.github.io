I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow working with [Maneesh Sahani](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Emaneesh) at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL, and [Jennifer Linden](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/research/profiles/linden) at the Ear Institute, UCL. More recently, I also started to work with [Jasper Poort](http://selectivevisionforaction.blogspot.co.uk) (SWC) on developing novel techniques to simultaneously monitor multiple behavioural and neural variables in freely moving mice and with [Adam Kampff's lab](http://www.kampff-lab.org/) on recording brain activity from thousands of neurons (in many brain areas) using high-density silicon probes.

My overall goal is to understand how sensory input is encoded in both single neurons and populations in sensory cortex. In my work I combine experiments in freely moving mice with methods from dynamical systems, statistical physics and machine learning to construct models of how sensory input is transformed into neural activity. However, not everything happening in sensory cortex is determinted by sensory input. Rather cortical activity also carries information about processes that are not locked to the stimulus, e.g., perception, decisions, or motor-related activity. By carefully monitoring behaviour and neural activity I hope to understand which activity patterns are related to sensory input or immediate behaviour and which patterns might give rise to higher cognitive processes.

During my PhD at the Institute of Physics at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, I developed computational models of sensory processing along the auditory pathway based on the spectro-temporal receptive field.
