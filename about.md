I am currently a [Radboud Excellence Fellow](http://www.ru.nl/excellence){:target="_blank"} at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/){:target="_blank"} working with [Francesco Battaglia](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/battaglia-f/){:target="_blank"}. My overall goal is to understand how sensory input is used to guide behaviour, and, in turn, how the resulting behaviour changes the way sensory input is being processed. To this end, I combine experiments in freely moving animals with methods from dynamical systems, statistical physics and machine learning to construct models of how sensory input is transformed into neural activity under natural conditions. In my current work [I combine large-scale neural recordings with head and eye tracking](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30822-5){:target="_blank"} and [virtual reality in freely moving mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/161232v1){:target="_blank"} to precisely characterize how movement-related signals shape visual cortical activity. The goal is to understand how different types of non-visual signals (efference copy, vestibular, proprioception) contribute to forming a stable percept of the world while the images of the world are rapidly sweeping across the retina. In a second step I will investigate the relation between active visual experience, passive visual stimulation, and visual memory.

Before I joined the Donders Institute, I was a research associate at University College London (UCL) working at the interface of computational neuroscience (with [Maneesh Sahani](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/%7Emaneesh){:target="_blank"} at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit), in-vivo neurophysiology, and detailed measurements of behaviour in freely moving animals (both with [Jennifer Linden](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/research/profiles/linden){:target="_blank"} at the Ear Institute, [John O'Keefe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/okeefe-lab){:target="_blank"} at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behavior](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/){:target="_blank"}, and [Jasper Poort](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/svl){:target="_blank"} at the University of Cambridge ).

During my PhD at the Institute of Physics at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, I developed computational models of sensory processing along the auditory pathway based on the spectro-temporal receptive field.
